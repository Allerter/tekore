# spotipy
A client for the Spotify Web API.

### plamere/spotipy
Replaces [plamere/spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy), which has not been maintained since the end of 2017.
Although refactored heavily from its original source, this package does largely rely on the original structure that
was put in place by plamere.
